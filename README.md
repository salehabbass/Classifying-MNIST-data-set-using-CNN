# Classifying-MNIST-data-set-using-CNN
the problem is we have 10 different classes of handwritten numbers from 0 to 9 and we have to recognize them using CNN, data set is built in into torchvision.datasets module, I used Pytorch library to implement the code and solve the problem, I have achieved Test accuracy: 98.71% you can use transfer learning to improve the accuracy.
